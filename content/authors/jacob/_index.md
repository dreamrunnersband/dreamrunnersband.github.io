This is Jacob, our songwriter and frontman. 

Jacob seems to follow three main principles:
1. A modern man only has control if he constantly tortures himself through cold showers and sleep deprivation.
2. “It’s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock ’n’ Roll)” is to be taken literally, and he will happily be robbed, stoned, beat up, broken boned, had, and took if it means playing even a single gig for a full house.
3. Any time not spent on music is horrifically wasted, studies and obligations be damned.
