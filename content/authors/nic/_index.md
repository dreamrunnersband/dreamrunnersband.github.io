This is our dreamdrummer Nic, The Italian. He was born as an olive plant in the fields of Italy and fed only drumsticks as a child. Once after a long night out he got lost and found himself in Munich, Germany. There he stayed for years playing drums untill finally hiking 3000 km to the streets of Flogsta, were we found him, ready to crank the toms on every stage in the world.
