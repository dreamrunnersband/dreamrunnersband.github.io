**Uppsala, Sweden** â€“ Dreamrunners are proud to announce the release of their new EP *Orange Highway*. Building on the foundation laid by their two high-energy singles released last year, this new collection of songs includes not only several new studio recordings, but also a live rendition of the title track. 

Dreamrunners have spent the better part of 2024 igniting Swedish crowds with their electrifying live performances, with the aim of bringing back guitar-driven classic rock with more power than ever, and now it is here!
