This is Fredrik. He is a unique man. Most bass players are known to be the failed guitarist who joins the band because they’re the friend who’s too nice to say no to. Fredrik instead has never touched a guitar and didn’t know what a guitar was until I explained it to him. Instead he was discovered at five years old by the Stockholm newspapers as a rising trombone prodigy. When he in his early teens realised that no rock band would ever want a trombone player, he instead took on the bass obsessively, with the goal of one day performing the first bass solo in history that the audience actually likes.
