In July, the four Dreamrunners embarked on an epic journey down to VÃ¤stervik to play at Far & Son Pub. The band has thus officially branched out of Uppsala, effectively launching their never-ending Swedish tour!

Check out [GIGS](/gigs) for the full schedule and contact us (or your local venue) if you want Dreamrunners to come to your town!
