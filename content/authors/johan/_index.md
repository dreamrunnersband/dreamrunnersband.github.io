Meet Johan, The engineer. He writes guitar solos in morse code. He uses this to his advantage when playing guitar. Sometimes this leads to very cool sounds, and sometimes he is the only person in the world to think it sounds cool. Sometimes he looks tired when practising in the band, but that is just because he is thinking about numbers, electricity and stuff. He likes numbers, electricity and stuff.
